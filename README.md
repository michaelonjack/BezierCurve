# BezierCurve
MATLAB script that compares two different algorithms for constructing Bezier curves

BezierScript is the main script file of the project. Within this script the user is asked to fill the
x and y vectors given to form ordered pairs. Once the vectors are filled with the added points, the user 
then runs the script file and the Bezier curve interpolating these points will be graphed as well as an
approximation to the Bezier curve. The average distance between the curves is then printed to the command line.

SUMMARY:
1.) Add numbers to x and y vector in script file to form ordered pairs
2.) Run the script file
3.) The Bezier curve interpolating these points with be graphed
4.) An approximation to the Bezier curve will also be graphed
5.) The average distance between curves will be printed to the command window

* At the beginning of each file there is a description of that particular file's purpose
